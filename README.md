# VOIDCREST - "STATIC BLOOM" - Project Bible

## 1. Visão Geral do Projeto

Este documento serve como o guia criativo e técnico para a produção do álbum de estreia da banda **VOIDCREST**, intitulado **"STATIC BLOOM"**. O objetivo é criar uma obra coesa, poderosa e com potencial de viralização global, visando um sucesso comercial e artístico massivo.

### A Banda: VOIDCREST

**VOIDCREST** é uma banda de metalcore/nu-metal progressivo cuja identidade sonora e lírica explora a dicotomia entre o caos e a resiliência. O nome representa a jornada de se erguer (**Crest**) a partir do vazio existencial e da opressão (**Void**).

### O Álbum: STATIC BLOOM

**"STATIC BLOOM"** é um álbum conceitual de 10 faixas que narra a jornada de um indivíduo através de um colapso mental e social até uma eventual transformação e autoaceitação. A história é contada em três atos:

*   **Ato I: The Static (Faixas 1-3):** A descida ao caos, opressão e a quebra do sistema interno.
*   **Ato II: The Spark (Faixas 4-7):** A transformação da dor em fúria, a rebelião e a primeira centelha de resiliência.
*   **Ato III: The Bloom (Faixas 8-10):** A reconstrução, a aceitação, a catarse e a conclusão emocional.

### Identidade Visual

A identidade visual da banda é centrada na arte conceitual **"O Criador"** (a figura esquelética com amplificadores), que serve como capa do álbum. A estética é um cyberpunk sombrio que colide com elementos orgânicos e de resiliência.

## 2. Fluxo de Trabalho e DNA Sonoro

Para garantir a consistência sonora e vocal em todas as faixas, o seguinte fluxo de trabalho deve ser seguido para cada produção no Suno AI.

*   **AI Singer:** Todas as faixas devem ser geradas utilizando o AI Singer customizado **"VOIDCREST Vocalist"**. Esta é a prioridade máxima para manter a identidade da banda.
*   **Método de Prompt:** A consistência instrumental será alcançada através de prompts de estilo ultra-detalhados para cada música, em vez de usar a função Vibe Seed. Cada prompt foi projetado para evocar uma faceta específica do som da banda, mantendo um DNA central.
*   **DNA Sonoro Central:** A sonoridade de VOIDCREST é definida por guitarras de 7 cordas pesadas e com afinação baixa, bateria poderosa com bumbo trigado e caixa nítida, baixo gordo e audível, e a integração de sintetizadores atmosféricos e glitches eletrônicos. A principal característica é a dinâmica vocal entre melodias limpas e poderosas e drives/gritos viscerais.

#### **1. Echoes in the Void**

```
Title: Echoes in the Void
Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Music: Dark, atmospheric synth pad with a clean, melancholic guitar melody over it. A simple, electronic beat starts.)
(Vocals: Melodic, tense whisper)
Glass walls around me, I watch the world pass by...
A million voices, but none of them hear my cry...
The static in my veins, a digital disease...
A ghost inside the machine, begging for release.

[Verse 1]
(Music: Drums become more organic, bass guitar enters with a heavy presence. Vocals are clean and melodic, with growing frustration.)
I walk on broken pieces of a promise I never made
And every single footstep is a price that must be paid
They're selling paradise on a bright LED screen
While my soul is screaming silent, feeling thirsty, feeling mean... so mean!

[Pre-Chorus]
(Music: Intensity builds. Distorted guitars enter with a rising riff. Vocals get a bit of grit and power.)
The pressure's building, I can't get enough air!
Every fiber of my being wants to break the snare!
My pulse is racing, a siren in the night!

[Chorus]
(Music: EXPLOSION! Full band, heavy down-tuned guitars, double bass drums, crashing cymbals. Vocals alternate between powerful melody and harsh screams.)
(HARSH SCREAM)
SHATTER THE SILENCE! WITH THE FURY OF A THUNDERCLAP!
(HIGH-PITCHED MELODIC VOCALS)
THIS ECHO IN THE VOID ESCAPES THE DIGITAL TRAP!
(GUTTURAL SCREAM)
NO LONGER JUST A SHADOW FADING IN THE DARK!
(POWERFUL MELODIC VOCALS)
MY VOICE IS MY WEAPON, I'M THE ANARCHY, THE SPARK!

[Verse 2]
(Music: Intensity pulls back slightly. The beat becomes more rhythmic and syncopated, Nu-Metal style. Vocals are melodic but with contained anger.)
The marionettes are dancing to a pre-recorded song
On a stage of cynicism, where everything is wrong
The manufactured smiles, the speeches made of dust
They build themselves an empire on a throne of broken trust.

[Pre-Chorus]
(Music: The build-up is faster and more aggressive this time.)
The lies are echoing, I'm done playing their game!
This whole programmed system will go down in flames!
The final countdown... is calling out my name!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Music: Abrupt stop. Only a synth pad and a clean guitar with heavy delay remain, creating a tense, atmospheric space. Vocals are soft and introspective, then build to a desperate scream.)
(Soft, melodic vocals)
In this abyss of mirrors, a stranger stared at me...
A broken reflection of what I used to be...
But the last remaining ember... still burns inside this cage...
Against the whole damn system... against all of its rage...

(Music: Drums enter with progressive fills, guitars build an epic crescendo.)
I AM THE GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM!
THE SCREAM THAT BREAKS THE RHYTHM!

(Scream: A long, powerful, emotional scream)
I WON'T BE A GHOST ANYMOOOOORE!

[Guitar Solo / Breakdown]

[Final Chorus / Outro]
(SCREAM/DRIVE)
SHATTER THE SILENCE! WITH THE FURY OF A THUNDERCLAP!
(AGGRESSIVE MELODY)
THIS ECHO IN THE VOID IS THE REVOLUTION!
(GUTTURAL SCREAM)
I'M NOT A FUCKING SHADOW FADING IN THE DARK!
(DRIVE VOCALS TO THE END)
MY VOICE IS MY WEAPON! MY INSURRECTION!

(Final word: A dry, cut-off scream)
GONE!

Style of Music:
Polished and modern progressive metalcore, anthemic nu-metal production. The sound is built on heavily distorted, down-tuned 7-string guitars with a tight, modern tone. Drums are powerful, featuring a punchy, triggered kick drum and a sharp, cracking snare, with prominent double bass patterns in heavy sections. The bass guitar is thick and slightly distorted, locked in with the kick drum. Haunting, atmospheric synth pads provide background texture. Vocals must maintain a consistent male voice, dynamically shifting between powerful clean melodies and visceral, raw harsh screams. Wide stereo image with clear separation between instruments.

Exclude From Style:
happy, pop, acoustic, soft rock, country
```

#### **2. The Parasite in My Head**

```
Title: The Parasite in My Head
Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Music: Dark, pulsing synth arpeggio like a fast heartbeat. A guitar with heavy reverb plays dissonant, single notes. Paranoid and tense atmosphere.)
(Vocals: Fragile, melodic whisper)
There's an echo in my skull, it refuses to go quiet...
A shadow that follows me, causing a riot...
It feeds on the fear, that I try to deny...
And whispers in the end, I'll just break down and cry...

[Verse 1]
(Music: A broken, electronic Nu-Metal beat kicks in. The bass is heavy and pulsing. The clean vocals get stronger, but still sound restrained, fighting for control.)
I try to smile, but the mirror calls my name
The mask that I'm wearing, it rejects the whole game
It knows every failure, every single rotten thought
And uses all my memories in the battles that we've fought.

[Pre-Chorus]
(Music: Builds intensity. Distorted guitars enter with a heavy, rising riff. Vocals start to get a slight drive, showing the strain of the fight.)
I feel its claws, scratching deep within me!
Turning me into everything I swore I'd never be!
The poison's rising, sanity's goodbye!

[Chorus]
(Music: TOTAL EXPLOSION! The band enters with maximum weight. The vocal dynamic is a furious dialogue between "me" (melodic) and the "parasite" (scream).)
(HARSH SCREAM)
GET OUT OF MY HEAD!
(POWERFUL MELODIC VOCALS)
I'M NOT THE MONSTER THAT YOU'VE MADE OF ME!
(HARSH SCREAM)
YOUR WEAKNESS IS MY STRENGTH TO BE!
(POWERFUL MELODIC VOCALS)
THIS WAR IS ONLY OVER WHEN I GET THE VICTORY!

[Verse 2]
(Music: Intensity pulls back a bit, the groove is more rhythmic. Vocals are melodic again, but now with a tone of exhaustion and anger.)
I lose my friends, I burn the bridges down
In a flash of pure fury, I abandon the whole town
And when the chaos settles, I'm the one who's left behind
Picking up the pieces of a man I cannot find.

[Pre-Chorus]
(Music: The build-up is even faster and more desperate. Vocals are on the edge between melodic and drive.)
I taste its flavor, like a metallic blight!
Pushing me to the abyss, into eternal night!
The final barrier... is about to break!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Music: Breaks down violently. A moment of silence, then a melancholic piano and synth pad. The vocals are vulnerable, almost crying.)
(Soft, melodic vocals)
Maybe I should just give in...
Let the parasite finally win...
Could there be some peace... in this final release?

(Music: Drums enter with cymbal swells, guitars build an epic, rising wall of sound. The vocals fill with new determination, growing into a scream of defiance.)
NO! The final breath... the final choice...
Is still my own! IT'S STILL MY OWN!
(LONG, VISCERAL SCREAM)
YOU WILL NOT HAVE ME!

[Guitar Solo / Breakdown]

[Final Chorus / Outro]
(SCREAM/DRIVE)
GET OUT OF MY HEAD!
(AGGRESSIVE MELODY)
I'M NOT THE MONSTER THAT YOU'VE MADE OF ME!
(HARSH SCREAM)
YOUR WEAKNESS IS MY STRENGTH TO BE!
(SCREAMING TO THE END)
THIS WAR IS ONLY OVER WHEN I FINALLY CEASE TO BE!

(Music stops. Only the sound of distorted, heavy breathing is heard, then it cuts off sharply.)

Style of Music:
Intense, emotional progressive metalcore, Nu-Metal anthem about internal conflict. Features schizophrenic vocal dynamics between powerful, clean melodic singing and visceral, raw harsh screams. Haunting atmospheric intro, heavy syncopated riffs, an epic guitar solo, and a crushing breakdown.

Exclude From Style:
happy, upbeat, pop, folk, acoustic, calm
```

#### **3. System Failure**

```
Title: System Failure
Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Music: Starts with the sound of a deep, resonant rumble, like the earth cracking, and a distant, distorted scream. A single, crushingly heavy, down-tuned guitar riff enters, slow and deliberate like a death march. No drums yet.)

[Verse 1]
The colors dissolve into a stain of pain
My veins are conduits for acid rain
Every door I try is just another wall
There's nothing behind this empty hall

[Pre-Chorus]
(Music: A simple, heavy drum beat enters. The guitar riff gets a bit more complex, building tension. Vocals rise in desperation.)
Is anyone there? Can you hear my plea?
Before the walls start crumbling on me...
I'm fading... I'm fading...

[Chorus]
(Music: EXPLOSION! But a slow, massive one. A wall of sound. The vocals are a soaring, heartbreakingly clean melody, layered with agonized screams.)
SYSTEM FAILURE! THE LIGHTS ALL FADE TO BLACK!
(AGONIZED SCREAM)
THERE'S NO REBOOT! NO TURNING BACK!
MY SOUL IS A BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH, A CRITICAL CRASH!
(AGONIZED SCREAM)
TURNING MY WHOLE WORLD TO ASH!

[Verse 2]
(Music: Returns to the heavy, marching riff of the verse. Vocals are strained, on the verge of breaking.)
I'm a ghost in my body, a stranger I see
Running on fumes of what I used to be
This foundation was never built to last
My future is buried by my past

[Pre-Chorus]
(Music: The build-up is more intense this time.)
Is anyone there? Can you hear my plea?
I'm watching the walls start crumbling on me!
I'm gone now... I'm gone now...

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Music: Everything cuts out except a single, clean, haunting guitar note and the sound of wind. The vocals are a fragile whisper.)
So just let me break...
For goodness sake...
End this... just end this...

[Breakdown]
(Music: From the whisper, it drops into the SLOWEST, HEAVIEST, most suffocating breakdown of the entire album. The riff is simple, primal, and crushing.)
(VOCAL: A single, long, guttural, inhuman scream of pure agony over the first part of the breakdown. No words.)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Music: The main heavy riff plays one last time, slower and slower, like a structure collapsing. It ends with the sound of the deep rumble from the intro, fading into silence.)

Style of Music:
A crushingly heavy, slow-tempo doomcore anthem about a complete internal collapse. The production must be polished and modern, built on a massive wall of sound from heavily distorted, down-tuned 7-string guitars with a tight, modern tone. The song should have a suffocating and desperate atmosphere, with minimalist, organic verses and an unforgettable, soaring, and tragically beautiful clean melody in the chorus. The chorus must lyrically blend human emotion with metaphors of technological failure. Layer the clean chorus vocals with agonized screams for maximum emotional impact. Features the band's slowest, heaviest, and most punishing breakdown.

Exclude From Style:
fast tempo, upbeat, happy, technical solos, punk rock, cheerful, hopeful, energetic

### Ato II: The Spark

---

#### **4. Venom in the Vows**

```
Title: Venom in the Vows
Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Music: Starts immediately with a heavy, fast, syncopated nu-metal guitar riff and aggressive drums. Short and impactful.)

[Verse 1]
Your face was a harbor, a place I could trust
But behind the smile, only demons and lust
You spun your web with words made of cotton and grace
And I was the fool who fell for that empty space

[Chorus]
(Music: EXPLOSION! A punchy, melodic and powerful chorus. Easy to shout along. Drives for emphasis.)
YOUR KISS HAD THE TASTE OF A LIE!
(DRIVE VOCAL)
YOUR EMBRACE WAS A CAGE!
YOUR VOWS WERE ALL VENOM, PUT MY SOUL ON A STAGE!
(HARSH SCREAM)
NOW ALL THAT IS LEFT IS THE RAGE!

[Verse 2]
Every memory we shared is now a haunting art
A twisted motion picture that tears me apart
Were you my cure, or were you the disease?
Deep down I think I knew I'd never find my peace

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Music: Breaks down to just a distorted bassline and a simple electronic beat. Vocals are a threatening, almost spoken whisper.)
You thought that you broke me?
Thought I would be destroyed?
You only awakened...
The monster I avoid.

[Guitar Solo / Breakdown]
(Music: A short, technical, and angry guitar solo that collapses into a heavy, rhythmic breakdown. No wasted notes.)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Music: The main riff plays one last time, then stops abruptly. A final, dry, hateful scream is heard.)
LIAR!

Style of Music:
A punchy and aggressive nu-metal anthem with a very catchy, melodic chorus. The song must have a standard, radio-friendly structure and a concise runtime, around 3 to 4 minutes. Use the signature heavy guitars and dynamic clean/scream vocals, but focus the energy on a powerful, memorable, and repeating chorus. The breakdown should be short and impactful.

Exclude From Style:
long intro, progressive, epic, lengthy instrumental sections, ambient, slow tempo, 8-minute song, experimental, folk
```

#### **5. Digital Gods**

```
Title: Digital Gods
Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Music: Starts with a glitchy electronic beat and a distorted dial-up modem sound that morphs into a technical, syncopated guitar riff.)

[Verse 1]
(Vocals: Fast-paced, rhythmic, almost-rapped clean vocals with an aggressive edge.)
Sitting on your thrones of manufactured light
Selling cheap salvation in the dead of night
You preach in pixels, a hollow new divine
And the zombies bow and whisper "God, I wish you were mine"

[Pre-Chorus]
(Music: Drums build with fast hi-hats. The riff becomes more intense. Vocals build towards a scream.)
You feed them poison, you call it the cure!
This counterfeit heaven won't endure!

[Chorus]
(Music: Explodes into a massive, mid-tempo chorus with soaring clean vocals and powerful screams. The synths carry the main harmony.)
WE WILL TEAR DOWN YOUR TEMPLES OF GLASS AND CHROME!
(HARSH SCREAM)
AND WATCH YOUR EMPTY KINGDOMS FALL!
YOU ARE THE DIGITAL GODS, ALONE ON YOUR THRONE!
(HARSH SCREAM)
BUT YOU'RE NOTHING! NOTHING AT ALL!

[Verse 2]
(Vocals: Same rapid-fire delivery.)
A million followers, but you don't have a friend
Just empty validation that will break and bend
You trade your soul for a trending, viral lie
While a generation learns how to slowly die

[Pre-Chorus]
You feed them poison, you call it the cure!
This counterfeit heaven... is so impure!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Music: Breaks down. A pulsing synth bassline with only electronic drums. Vocals are a processed, robotic whisper.)
Unfollow. Unsubscribe. Erase. Disconnect.
Time to tear down the idols we resurrect.

[Guitar Solo / Breakdown]
(Music: A technical, shred-heavy guitar solo over a complex, djent-influenced riff. It ends in a syncopated, head-spinning breakdown with glitchy electronic stutters.)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Music: The main riff plays one last time, but it starts to glitch and break apart, slowing down until it cuts out into the sound of a single, clean 'unplug' sound effect.)

Style of Music:
A technical and aggressive progressive metalcore anthem with heavy industrial and electronic influences. The song must feature complex, syncopated, and groovy guitar riffs. The verses should have a rapid-fire, rhythmic vocal delivery, contrasting with a massive, soaring melodic chorus. Incorporate prominent glitchy synths and electronic elements. The track needs a technical guitar solo and a complex, djent-influenced breakdown. The mood is calculated, furious, and defiant.

Exclude From Style:
simple, punk rock, slow, ballad, minimalist, organic, acoustic
```

#### **6. Redline**

```
Title: Redline
Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Music: No warning. Explodes immediately with a chaotic, fast-paced thrash metal riff and blast beat drumming. Pure aggression from the first second.)

[Verse 1]
(Vocals: Spat out, rapid-fire, almost breathless.)
Static in my vision, fire in my blood
Drowning in the silence, buried by the flood
Every wall is closing, every breath's a fight
Stuck inside this cage of endless, blackest night!

[Chorus]
(Music: A brutally simple, two-line chorus designed to be shouted by a crowd.)
(ALL VOCALS SCREAMED)
THE PRESSURE'S AT THE REDLINE!
MY MIND IS GONNA BREAK!

[Verse 2]
(Vocals: Even more frantic and desperate.)
The clock is ticking faster, a hammer in my head
Living with the voices of the living and the dead
Scratching at the surface, trying to get out
Drowned out by the volume of my own self-doubt!

[Chorus]
(ALL VOCALS SCREAMED)
THE PRESSURE'S AT THE REDLINE!
MY MIND IS GONNA BREAK!

[Bridge]
(Music: The instruments drop into a tense, driving, palm-muted chug on one note. The drums build on the cymbals. The vocals are a tense, building whisper.)
(Whisper)
This noise inside... can't stop the noise...
(Building intensity)
This static scream... has found its voice...
(Full-throated shout)
IT'S TAKING OVER! CAN'T HOLD IT BACK!
(Desperate, final, imploring for the end of the torment)
JUST GIVE ME ONE MOMENT OF...

[THE SCREAM]
(Music: The guitars hold one, long, sustained power chord. The cymbals wash out.)
(VOCALS: The iconic, album-defining scream. The word is "SILENCE", held for as long as humanly possible. The vocalist must sustain the middle "AIIIIIIIL" sound for 12+ seconds, with the voice cracking and breaking with raw agony before finishing the word with a guttural, exhausted "ENCE".)
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILENCE!

[Breakdown / Final Chorus]
(Music: The second the scream ends, the band comes crashing back in with a brutally heavy, mid-tempo breakdown. After two bars, the chorus is screamed one last time over it, with a crucial change.)
THE PRESSURE'S AT THE REDLINE!
MY MIND IS GONNA BREAK!
THE PRESSURE'S AT THE REDLINE!
MY FUCKING MIND JUST...

[Outro]
(Music: The song ends with a final, massive breakdown hit that syncs up with the last word, followed by the sound of sharp, digital static cutting to silence.)
(Final word screamed alone)
BROKE!

Style of Music:
The fastest and most aggressive song on the album. A raw, chaotic metalcore anthem with thrash metal and punk rock energy. The song's absolute centerpiece is an iconic, extremely long, and cathartic scream on the word 'SILENCE'. This scream must be held for over 12 seconds, capturing a moment of pure, agonized release. The production should be aggressive and in-your-face, leading to a brutally heavy breakdown immediately following the scream.

Exclude From Style:
slow, melodic, progressive, clean vocals, ballad, atmospheric, quiet, subtle
```

#### **7. Ashes of Tomorrow**

```
Title: Ashes of Tomorrow
Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Music: Starts with a clean electric guitar with delay, playing a melancholic, repeating melody. An open synth pad creates an atmospheric, vast feeling. The drums enter with a simple, subdued hi-hat and rim-click pattern.)

[Verse 1]
The static is gone... now the silence rings...
Where the fury once burned, a quiet wind sings...
Ghosts of who we were, dancing in the dust...
In this broken kingdom, we've learned to adjust.

[Pre-Chorus]
(Music: The song starts to build tension. Palm-muted guitars enter, creating a crescendo. The vocals gain strength and a slight edge.)
But in the ruins of yesterday, an ember still glows!
A stubborn little spark that defies all its foes!
The pulse that is still beating, is a war drum that I know!

[Chorus]
(Music: The explosion is more melodic and grand than before. It's a soaring anthem.)
(SOARING, EPIC CLEAN VOCALS)
FROM THE ASHES OF TOMORROW, WE WILL RISE AGAIN!
(HARSH SCREAM, PUNCTUATING THE EMOTION)
FORGED IN THE FIRE OF OUR PAIN!
(SOARING CLEAN VOCALS)
WITH HEARTS MADE OF STEEL, WE'LL REBUILD AND ASCEND!
(HARSH SCREAM)
WASHING AWAY THE FINAL STAIN!

[Verse 2]
(Music: The base gets heavier and more rhythmic. The clean vocals have a cold, determined tone.)
We wear the cracks now, like our armor plate
Every flaw is a map to escape our fate
We don't seek vengeance, we don't ask for grace
Just a place to stand, in this empty space.

[Pre-Chorus]
The memory of falling, has taught us how to fly!
Against the weight of the world, we will reach for the sky!
A new sun is dawning, you can see it in my eye!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Music: Breaks into an atmospheric section, similar to the intro but with more movement. The vocals are introspective and full of emotion.)
(Soft, melodic vocals)
Every step we take, on the ground that we broke...
Is a tribute to all... the last words we spoke...
But we are not ghosts...
(The music explodes into an epic crescendo, the vocals rise to a scream of pure catharsis)
WE ARE THE PROMISE OF A NEW DAWN!

[Guitar Solo / Breakdown]
(Music: An extremely melodic and emotional guitar solo. It ends and the music drops into a crushingly slow and heavy breakdown.)
(GUTTURAL SCREAM)
RE-BORN!

[Final Chorus / Outro]
(The final chorus comes in with the energy of the breakdown. It's the most desperate and powerful version.)
FROM THE ASHES OF TOMORROW, WE WILL RISE AGAIN!
(HARSH SCREAM)
FORGED IN THE FIRE OF OUR PAIN!
(The music stops abruptly, leaving only the clean guitar from the intro. It plays for a few seconds and then fades to silence.)

Style of Music:
An epic and atmospheric post-hardcore anthem about resilience and hope. The song must be highly dynamic, building from a quiet, clean, and melancholic post-rock style intro into a massive, soaring, and powerful chorus. The clean vocals should be the main focus, delivering a grand, anthemic melody. The signature heavy guitars and harsh screams should be used strategically for emotional impact and contrast, not constant aggression. Features an emotional, melodic guitar solo that transitions into a crushingly heavy, slow breakdown, representing the memory of past struggles. The overall mood is somber but ultimately defiant and hopeful.

Exclude From Style:
raw aggression, punk rock, fast tempo, chaotic, purely electronic, happy, simple structure

### Ato III: The Bloom

#### **8. Clear the Signal**

```
Title: Clear the Signal
Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Music: Starts with just a simple, melancholic piano melody and the faint sound of rain on a window.)

[Verse 1]
(Music: A clean, steady trip-hop beat enters. Vocals are soft, almost spoken, full of weariness.)
I'm tired of the shouting, tired of the fight
Just wanna find a reason in the fading light
All the ghosts of yesterday, I'm letting them pass through
Disconnecting from the noise to find what's true.

[Chorus]
(Music: Cinematic strings swell into the mix. The vocals soar, clean and full of emotion. No screams.)
I'm clearing the signal now, letting the static die
Searching for the silence hidden in the sky
I'm letting go of who I was supposed to be
And in this quiet moment, I can finally see me.

[Verse 2]
(Music: A subtle synth bassline is added, giving the track more depth. Vocals are a bit stronger.)
The anger was an anchor, it held me to the ground
But in this heavy ocean, I just slowly drowned
No more fighting monsters, no more winning wars
Just closing my eyes and closing all the doors.

[Chorus]
(Music: The strings are more prominent, the beat is more complex. The vocal harmonies are layered and immense.)
I'm clearing the signal now, letting the static die
Searching for the silence hidden in the sky
I'm letting go of who I was supposed to be
And in this quiet moment, I can finally see me.

[Bridge]
(Music: The beat cuts out, leaving only the piano and swelling strings. It feels like a moment of epiphany.)
And the final echo... fades away...
And I can hear my own heart beat... for the first time today...

[Climax / Outro]
(Music: The beat crashes back in, bigger than before. For the first time, a HEAVY, DISTORTED GUITAR CHORD hits and sustains in the
